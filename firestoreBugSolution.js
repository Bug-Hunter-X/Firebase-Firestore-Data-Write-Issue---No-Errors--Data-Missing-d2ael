The problem was due to incorrect Firestore security rules.  The rules were overly restrictive, preventing write access even with seemingly correct authentication.  The solution was to adjust the security rules to allow writing:

```javascript
// firestoreBugSolution.js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore, doc, setDoc } from "firebase/firestore";

// Your Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  // ...
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);

async function writeData(){
  try {
    const docRef = doc(db, "yourCollection", "yourDocumentID");
    await setDoc(docRef, {
      field1: "value1",
      field2: "value2",
    });
    console.log("Data written with ID: ", docRef.id);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error writing document: ", error);
  }
}
writeData();

// Security Rules (firestore.rules)
// allow read, write: if request.auth != null; 
```
Ensure your security rules are appropriately configured to allow writing to your database based on your authentication methods.
